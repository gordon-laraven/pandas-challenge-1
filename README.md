# Client Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a client dataset to extract insights about customer purchases, item categories, shipping costs, and profits. The analysis uses the Pandas library in Python to manipulate and summarize the data effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the following library:
- `pandas`: You can install it via pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is `client_dataset.csv`, which should be placed in the same directory as your script.

## Usage
The analysis is structured into several parts, executable in a Python script or Jupyter Notebook.

### Part 1: Load the Data
Import the data from the CSV file.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('client_dataset.csv')
```

### Part 2: Explore the Data
Basic statistics and insights about the dataset can be observed with the following commands:

```python
df.head(10)
print(df.columns)
print(df.describe())
df.info()
```

### Part 3: Identify Item Categories
The top three item categories by entry count are:
- What three item categories had the most entries?
- For the category with the most entries, which subcategory had the most entries?

```python
item_categories = df['category'].value_counts().head(3)
print(item_categories)
```

### Part 4: Analyze Client Purchases
Identify the five clients with the most entries and analyze their total unit purchases:
- Which five clients had the most entries in the data?
- Store the client ids of those top 5 clients in a list.
- How many total units (the qty column) did the client with the most entries order?

```python
client_counts = df['client_id'].value_counts().head(5)
print(client_counts)
```

### Part 5: Transformation of Data
Add various columns to analyze total expenditures, shipping costs, and profits:
- Create a column that calculates the subtotal for each line using the unit_price and the qty.
- Create a column for shipping price. Assume a shipping price of $7 per pound for orders over 50 pounds and $10 per pound for items 50 pounds or under.
- Create a column for the total price using the subtotal and the shipping price along with a sales tax of 9.25%.
- Create a column for the cost of each line using unit cost, qty, and shipping price (assume the shipping cost is exactly what is charged to the client).
- Create a column for the profit of each line using line cost and line price.

```python
df['subtotal'] = df['unit_price'] * df['qty']
df['total_weight'] = df['qty'] * df['unit_weight']
df['shipping_price'] = [w * 7 if w > 50 else w * 10 for w in df['total_weight']]
df['total_price'] = round(df['subtotal'] + df['shipping_price'] * 1.0925, 2)
df['line_cost'] = df['unit_cost'] * df['qty'] + df['shipping_price']
df['line_profit'] = df['total_price'] - df['line_cost']
```

### Part 6: Confirm Calculations
Verify calculations against known total prices from receipts:
- Order ID 2742071 had a total price of $152,811.89
- Order ID 2173913 had a total price of $162,388.71
- Order ID 6128929 had a total price of $923,441.25

Confirm that your calculations match the receipts. Remember, each order has multiple lines.

```python
receipts = {2742071: 152811.89, 2173913: 162388.71, 6128929: 923441.25}
```

### Part 7: Summary of Client Spending
Create a summarized DataFrame of the top clients:
- Use the new columns with confirmed values to find the following information.
- How much did each of the top 5 clients by quantity spend?
- Create a summary DataFrame showing the totals for the top 5 clients with the following information: total units purchased, total shipping price, total revenue, and total profit.

```python
summary_df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(top_client_spending).T.reset_index()
```

### Part 8: Sort and Present Findings
Sort the summary and present findings:
- Create a function to change the currency to millions of dollars. 
- Format the data and rename the columns to be suitable for presentation. 
- Then, sort the DataFrame in descending order by total profits.

```python
sorted_summary_df = summary_df.sort_values('Total Profit (Millions)', ascending=False)
print(sorted_summary_df)
```

### Part 9: Summary of Findings
After analyzing the data, the top five clients by quantity spent significantly, with their total revenue and profit varying greatly. Among these clients, the highest profit was generated from the client with the highest spending, showcasing the importance of customer relationships. This analysis can aid in targeting high-value clients for future marketing and sales strategies.
